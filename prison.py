'''
This Python module models the three-player Prisoner's Dilemma game.
We use the integer "0" to represent cooperation, and "1" to represent 
defection. 

Recall that in the 2-players dilemma, U(DC) > U(CC) > U(DD) > U(CD), where
we give the payoff for the first player in the list. We want the three-player game 
to resemble the 2-player game whenever one player's response is fixed, and we
also want symmetry, so U(CCD) = U(CDC) etc. This gives the unique ordering

U(DCC) > U(CCC) > U(DDC) > U(CDC) > U(DDD) > U(CDD)

The payoffs for player 1 are given by the following matrix:

PAYOFF = [[[6, 3], [3, 0]], [[8, 5], [5, 2]]]
NROUNDS = 100

"""
So payoff[i][j][k] represents the payoff to player 1 when the first
player's action is i, the second player's action is j, and the
third player's action is k.

In this simulation, triples of players will play each other repeatedly in a
'match'. A match consists of about 100 rounds, and your score from that match
is the average of the payoffs from each round of that match. For each round, your
strategy is given a list of the previous plays (so you can remember what your 
opponent did) and must compute the next action.
